- `speaker-name-map`: Replace speaker names, e.g. `{"You": "Michael", "Jim Halpert": "Jim" }`
- `transcript-format-meeting`: The format to used for the meeting details when copying the transcript to the clipboard
- `transcript-format-session-join`: The string to use to join multiple sessions within a meeting. New sessions are created every time transcribing begins.
- `transcript-format-speaker`: The format used for individual comments in the transcript.
